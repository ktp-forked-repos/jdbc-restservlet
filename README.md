# jdbc-restservlet
Web application that can be used as a REST API. The main idea is to reduce the middle tier development and keep the focus on client side development and database. This application is build on jdbc-rest driver.

Key feavures:
* REST API based on link [jdbc-rest](https://github.com/vnetcon/jdbc-rest) driver (select/insert/update/delete)
* email endpoint for sending emails
* upload endpoint for storing files into database (under development)
* download endpoint for retrieving files from database (under development)
